* Add a link to download as CSV.
* Check if a navigation menu on the left hand side is useful. See
  http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/examples/fluid.html
* Handle/follow redirects.

* Allow the application to inline queries and templates. A collection
  can point to documents that contain queries and templates with link
  relations, the client should be able to fetch these and inline them.

  Might have to be done on the server side. Should probably make this
  an optional feature enabled with cookies or something.

Usability
* For usability for newcomers to C+J consider adding explanatory texts
  all over the application. Explain where data comes from, why
  something is missing (missing fields etc). Allow the user close
  warnings and have the browser remember which warnings has been
  silenced.
